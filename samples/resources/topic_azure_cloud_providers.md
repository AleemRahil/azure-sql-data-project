# Cloud Providers

The cloud provider is responsible for the physical hardware required to execute
your work, and for keeping it up-to-date. The computing services offered tend to
vary by cloud provider. However, typically they include:

1. Compute power - such as Linux servers or web applications used for computation and processing tasks
2. Storage - such as files and databases
3. Networking - such as secure connections between the cloud provider and your company
4. Analytics - such as visualizing telemetry and performance data
