## What is the Azure free account

The Azure free account includes free access to popular Azure products for 12 months,
\$200 USD credit to spend for the first 30 days, and access to more than 25 products
that are always free. This is an excellent way for new users to get started and explore.
To sign up, you need a phone number, a credit card, and a Microsoft or GitHub account.
Credit card information is used for identity verification only. You won't be charged for
any services until you upgrade.

## Sign up for a free account

- Scroll down through the page to learn more about the benefits and free services available.
- Select **Start free**.
- Sign in with your **Microsoft or GitHub** account or create a free Microsoft account.
- On the About you page, select your correct country or region. Enter your first and last name, email
  address, and phone number. Depending on your country, you might see additional fields, such as a
  VAT number. Select **Next** to continue.
- On the Identity verification by phone screen, select your country code, and type the number of a telephone to
  which you have immediate access.
- You have the option of text or callback to obtain a verification code. Select the relevant button, type the
  code in the Verification code box, and select Verify code.
- If the verification code is correct, you're asked to enter details of a valid credit card. Enter the
  card information and select Next.
